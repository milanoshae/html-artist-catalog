    <h4>I CAN KINDA GET OVER YOU </h4>

    <h5>Inspiration and Process</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Genre: Indie</li>
        <li>Song link</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This song is purely an experiment in which I attempted to blend two genres: <em>indie</em> and <em>lo-fi</em>. I started writing this song after listening to a song by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/53PfGBaU0lzK2LOQOkJBoQ?si=qCsy0wqdSGi006sBSL13cw"><em>Tensen</em></a>, a great friend of mine from India. Varanasi is the name of his song. I wanted to produce something similar, but with a more somber feel, to his song, which was fairly chill yet had a lofi kick to it.</p>
    <p>I started experimenting with a variety of samples and vsts, and this particular vst called arcade by <em>output</em> software assisted me in grabbing some melodic loops. There were some string, piano, and percussion loops, so I chopped them up and made the main melodic loop that you hear in the song, added some eq, compreesion, reverb, and there it was. </p>
    <p>For the mixing and mastering, I recorded my own guitar, a les paul epiphone, and constructed a indie kinda yet lofi drum loop using a couple of drum samples from a pack that I downloaded on splice. </p>
    <p>I normally utilize stock plugins to test my limits and see where they can lead me, and if they satisfy me, I won't use any third-party plugins unless it's for a creative process. I used a maximus on FL STUDIO for masteriing with a little bit of EQ</p>

    <h4>STUCKED VOICES</h4>
    <img class="album-cover" src="./assets/stucked voiced.jpg" alt="stucked voices album cover">
    <h5>Inspiration and Process</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Genre: Lofi Alternative/Ambient</li>
        <li>Song link</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This song came about as a result of an emotion I was going through at the time I was producing this song. I was struggling with some personal troubles in a relationship, and I had a lot of things I wanted to say but couldn't because my words were stuck and that's the inpiration behind this song. I made the song name "stucked" adding "ed" to portray the imperfection of my feelings</p>
    <p>I took a splice guitar loop, chopped it up, and arranged it in an unusual way to make it distinct, and I guess I pitched it up a couple of semitones, and I constructed the chord progression based on the guitar loop, and that was the foundation of the whole song. To express my unspeakable emotions I used a granular synth to release bits and pieces of the vocal chop loop, then looped those fragments for a couple of seconds and produced another melodic loop out of it, which you can hear at the 1.44 minute mark in the piece and is my favorite portion of the song.</p>

    <h4>EMPTY</h4>

    <p>Listening to "shallou" inspired me to write this song. He is a vocalist and producer from Los Angeles. His songs have a different vibe than anything I've heard before, and it was refreshing to hear something new. It was dreamy and peaceful, something I haven't attempted in my own work. My music has always had a gloomy tone to it. This song is an attempt by me to make things happier.</p>
    <p>The technical components of producing this song that I've learned include how to correctly work with a lot of reverb and mix them in a pleasant clear way that doesn't annoy the listener's ear that is what I believe shallou excels at, and I wanted to learn it. A lot of reverb eqing and compression, on individual reverb buses. The best part about producing this song was that I had to learn those techniques by experimenting because I couldn't find any tutorials or lessons on how to produce this exact dream house vibey style at the time I was producing it, so I had to figure it out all by myself. They is lot of room to grow but I think I did a solid job</p>
